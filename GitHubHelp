How to create a new repo from an old branch in another repo:

    Create the <new_repo> in github.
    cd to your local copy of the old repo you want to extract from, which is set up to track the <old_branch> that will become the <new_repo>'s master.
    $ git push git@github.com:<accountname>/<new_repo> +<old_branch>:master

The new Github repo is finished. The result is;

    a new Github repository named <new_repo>,
    whose master corresponds to <old_branch>, with
    all history preserved.
